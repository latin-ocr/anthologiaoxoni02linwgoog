ANTEOLOGIA oxommls.

Yet& prophet-like, the lone one stood,
With dnuntless wenis and high,

Thac shook the selu· leaves from the wood,
As if Β, stom: passed by;

Saying, “ We are twins in death, pre-ud Suu,
Thy face is ool-1, thy me is run,

’T ie Memy bida thee ξος

For thou oen thousand thousand years

Hm seen the tide of human tem-s,
Thac shall no longer flow.

“ This spirit shall retum to Him

That gave its heavenly spnrk3

Yet think not, Sun, it shall be dim
When thou thyself nrt dark.

No l it shall live again, md shine

In blise unknown to bea-ms of thina ;
By ffim recalled to breath,

Who captive led eaptivity,

who robbod the grave of victory,
And took the sting from Death.
