Or leave a kias but in the cup,
And I'l} not look for wine<

The {hirst that from the seul doeh riae
Doth mk n drink divine;

But, might I of Jove’s nectar sip,
I would not change sor thine.

I sent thee late a tosy wreath,
Not so munh honouping thee,

As giving it n hope, that there
Ῑι might not withered be z

But thou thereon ‹lidst only bmnthe,
And sent‘st it buck to me;

Since when it grows, aud smells, I swenr,

Not of itselfl but thee.
