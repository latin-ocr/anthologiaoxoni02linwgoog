Fue Isabel, poor simple Isabel!
Lorenzo, a young palmer in Love’s eye Ῐ
They could not in the selfsume mansion dwell
Without some eth· of hem, some mahdy ;
They could not sit at meals but feel how well
It soothb'd each to be the other by;
They oould not, sure, benenth the seme roos sleep,
But to each other dream and nightly weep.

With every mom their love grew tenderet,
With every eve deeper and tenderer stffl3
He might not iu house, field, οι· garden, stix,
But her fun shnpe would ul! his meing fill;
And his contium! voioe was pleasanter
To her, than nolae of trees or hidden rill ,
Her lute-string gave an echo of his name,
She spoilt her half-done broidery with the same,

He knew whose gentle hand was at the laceb,
Before the door had given her to his eyes ς

And from her chamber window he would catch
Her beauty further thau the falcon §pies ;

And constant as her vespere would he wanoh,
Because her face was turned ω the same skies3

And with sick luuging all the night outwm,

To hear her morning step upon the mir.
