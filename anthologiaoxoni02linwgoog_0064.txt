On in danger, yet alive,

We are mmo to thirty-five:
Long my better years arx-ive!
Better years than thirty—five.
Could philosopha-s oontrive

Life m stop at thirty-five,

Time bis houm should never drive
O’er the bounds of thirty-five<
High to soar, and deep to dive,
Nature gives nt thirty-five,
Ladies, stoek md tend your hive,
Trifle not at thirty-five:

For howe’er we bouet aud atrive
Life declines at thirtyfive.

He that ever hopes to thrive
Must begin by thirty-five:

And nu who wisely wish to wive
Must look on Thrale nt thirty-five.

Johnson.
