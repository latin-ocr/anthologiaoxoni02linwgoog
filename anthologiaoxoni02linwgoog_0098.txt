Aa worldly shapen shall malt in gloum,
The Suu himself must die,

Before this mortu] slull assume
Im immortality.

I saw a vision in my sleep,

Thac gave my spidt strength ιο sweep
Adown the gulf of Time;

I saw the last of hun-mu mould,

'But shall Orestion& death behold,
As Adam saw her prime<

The Sun'n eye had a sickly glute,
The earth with nge was wan,
The ekeletons of natione were
Amund that lonely mm ι
Some lud expired in fight, — the bmnds
Stil] meved in their bony hands ;
Iu plague md famine some.
Euth's cities had no sound nor trend3
And ships were drifting with the deul
To shores where all wne dumb.
