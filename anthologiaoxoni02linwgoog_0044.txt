vnl-
’ὼ suam.

If Ι Ιιιᾶ thought thou oouldst have died,
I might not weep for them

But Ι furgat, when at thy side,
Thnt thou couldst mon-tal be:

It never through my mind had passed,
The time would e'er be οέι,

And I on thee should look my last,
And thou shouldst smila no mom.

And still upon that suae I look,
And think ‘t will smila again ;

And still the thought I will not brook,
That Ι umet look in vain!

But, when 1 spe=k‚—thou dost not say,
What thou ne'er lest’st unsuid3

And now I feel, us well Ι may,
Sweet Muyl thou m dandi

If thou wouldst stay, e'en us thou nrt,
All eold and ull serene,—

Ι still might prese thy silent hamt,
And where thy smiles have been!
