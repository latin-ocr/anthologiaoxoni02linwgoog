⁷⁹ Afflozoom OXONIENSIS-

 

 

xmn.

mut mse.

Tm: rose hul been wuhed, just wnshed in a shower,
Which Mary to Amm oonveyed;

The plentiful maist-ne ennumbered the flmver,
And weigherl down its benut-ifixl hanni

The nup wne su filled, md the leaves were all wet3
And it seen-ned to a fmfflul view,

To weep for the buda it had left with regn-et
On the flourishing bush where it grew.

1 lmtily seized it, unfit ss it wne

For a nosegay, so dripping und dronae&
And swinging it mdely, too rudely, dus 1

I smpped it, it fell ιο the groumL

“ Auel such‚” I exclaimed, “ ia the pitilm part
Some aot by the delicate mind,

Regmdless of wringing and breaking a haut
Alseady to son-ow resigned.

‘¹ Thia elegunt rose, had I shaken it less,
Mjght have bloomesl with its owner awhile ;
And the teu, that is wiped with a lime address,
May be followed perhnps by Β, smile.”
