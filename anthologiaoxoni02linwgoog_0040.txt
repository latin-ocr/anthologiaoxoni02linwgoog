Tfflw bid me esseep, they bid me pmy,
They say my brnin is warped md wrang3—
I cannot sleep on Highland brae,
1 annot pmy iu Highland tongue.
But were I now where AIlan glides,
Or hem-d my native Devau's tides,
So sweelly would 1 rest, and pmy
Thac Henven would close my wintry day!

’T was thus my hair they bade me braid,
They bade me ιο the chun-eh περαίη
It was my brirhl mom, they said,
Ami my true-love would meet me there:
But woe hedde the eruel guile
That dmwned iu blood the morning emi-le!
And woe betide the fain-y dream!
I only waksd to sob and acreum.
