‘Tm sung in ancient minstrelsy
Thac Phoebus wont m wem·
The leaves of any ple-sant tree
Amund his golden hair,
Till Daphne, despemw with parauit
Of hie imperium love,
At her own pmyer trausformed, took root
A laurel in the grove.

Then did the Penitent ndorn
His brow with lam-el greem
And ’mid his brighoe looks never shom
No manner lens was seem
And poeta uage, iu every nge,
About their templee wound
The διγς aud oonquerors tlumked the gods
With laurel nhnplets orowned.

Into the miste of ssabfing time
So fur runs bmks the pruine

Ofbenuty, which disdnins to climb
Along forbidden ways ς

Tlmt morus temptation, power defles,
where mutual love is ιιοις

And to the tomb for resoue flies
When life would be ὲ, blot.

Wurneworm.
