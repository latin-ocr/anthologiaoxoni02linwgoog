‘¹ Rome, for empire far renuwned,
Tmmplen on ythousand statem
Soon her pride slmll kias the ground—-
Han-k! therGuul is at her gates!

“ Other Romans shall arise,
Heedlaes of a soldier's nume ;
Souuds, not arms, shall win the prize,
liu-rnony the path ιο fune.

‘¹ Then the progeny that springs
From the foreste of our lund,
Anned with thunder, elad with winga,

Slwn a wider world mmmm-ld.

“ Reginus Casu never knew
Thy posta-icy shall swny;
Where his angles never ssew,

Nune inv-lucible aa they.”

Such the bmd's prophetie words,
l’regnmt with celestia! fite,

Bending as he swept the chorda
Of his sweet but awful lyre.
