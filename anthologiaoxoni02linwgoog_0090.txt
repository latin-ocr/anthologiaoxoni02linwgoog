To ffir Fidele’s grunay tumb
Soft maffia md village binde shall bring
Ench opening sweet of earliest bloom,
And risse all the breathing spring.

No wau-ing ghent shall dare appear,

To vex with shrieks this quiet grove ;
But shepherd luds semble here,

And melting virgins own their love.

No witha-ed wiwh shall heoee be seen,
No goblins lead their midnight arev:

The female Fays shall haunt the green,
And dress thy gave with peusly dew-

τιὴ, red-brem 0st ιι evening houm
Shffl kindly lena ms lime affl,

With hom-y mose and gathered floweffl
To deok the ground where thou art lai&
