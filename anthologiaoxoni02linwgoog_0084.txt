Thus while my joyless minute: tediuus flou,
With looks demure, und silent paee, a Dun.
Horrible monster 1 haoed by Gods aud men,

To my ιὸτίιὶ cimel amends.

With θοαὶ hoel, thu-ine thundering nt my gnte,
With hideous nocent thrioe he edlu I know
The voice ill-hodia& :md the solemn sound.
What should l du? or whither turn ἲ Amnzed,
Confounded, to the dnrk reeens Ι fly

Of wood-hole z straight my bristling haim erect
Through uudden seam a chilly uweat bedews
My shuddering limba, md (wonderful w tell !)
My tongue fol-geta her faeulty of speech

So horrible he seems 1 His faded brow
Entrenched with many a frown, aud eonio beu-d,

ἶ And sprending band, mimired by modern saints,

 

Disnstrous acts forbode: in his right hand
Long scrolls of pnper solemnly he wnves,
With characters and figures dire inscribed,
Grievous ω mortal eyes; (ye Gods, avere
Such plngues from righteous men l) Behind him scalke
Another monster not unlike himself, ¹*
Sullen of aspect, by the vulgu- called

A Catehpole, whose polluted hands the Gods
With forne incredffile, and magio chal-ms

Em hnve endued: Ifhe his ample palm
Should haply on ill-inmo} shoulder hy

Of debtor, straight his body, ω the much
Obsequium, (aa whilome knights were weng)
