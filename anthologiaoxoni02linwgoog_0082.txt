nnn the man, who,¹ void of mres and strife3
In silken or in lentham pun-se remim

A splefidid shilling- He nor hears with pain
New oystere cried, nor sigla sor chem-sul ale:
But with his ffiends, wheu nightly miste mise,
To J uniper's Magpie, or Town Hnll, τεμῶ-η
VVhen-e, mindful of the nymph whose wauton eye
Trunsflxed his seul, aud kindled amemus fimes,
Chloe ur Phillis, he, ench circling glase,

Wishes her hedth, und joy, and equa] love.
Meanwhile he smokee, and hughe at mer-ry tale,
Or pun ambiguous, or conundrum quint.

But I, whom griping penury sul-munds,

Ami hunger, aure mendant upon want,

With scanty offisss, and small aeid tiff,
(Wrenzhed mpusss) my meagm curse eusmiu:
Tbeu solitu-y walk‚ ox dom at home

In gun-ret vile, md with n warming puff

Regale chilled fingere 3 or from tube ns blank
As winter chimney, or well polished jet,

Exhnle munduugus, ill-perfuming scant.
