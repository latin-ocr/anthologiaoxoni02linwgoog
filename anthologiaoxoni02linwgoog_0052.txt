Amal they lud been friends in youth3
But whispering tongues ean poison truth;
And eonstancy dwells in malque above3
And life is thomy3 and youth is vnim
And to be wroth w-ith one we love
Doth work like mndness in the bra-in.
Each spnke words of high disdaiu
And insult ω his hant's best brother3
They pmed—ne’er ιο meet again}
But never either found another
To freae the hollow hem from painiug ; —
They stood aloof, the scm-s remaining,
Like cliffs which had been rent munder 3
A drensy sea now flows between 3—
But neither haut, nor frast, nor thu-ader,
shall wholly do away, I weeu, ¹

The' marks of abac which once bath hm.
Colendge.
