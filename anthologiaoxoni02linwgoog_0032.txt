WHEN the British warrior-queen,
Bleediug from the Roman rods,

Sought, with an indignmt mien,
Couneel of her oountry’s gods ;

Saga beneath the sprending onk
Sat the Druid, hom-y chief ;

, Every burning word he spoke

 

Fun of ruge, und full of grief.

“ Pfinoess! is nm· agad eyes
Weep upon thy muchlena wrongs,
T is because xesentment ties

All the ten-ors of our vongues.

‘¹ Rome shall perish — write that word
In the blood that she has spilt3
Pan-ish, hopeless aud abhorred,
Deep in ruins as in guflt.
