AETROLOGIA OXONOENSIS.

 

 

ιι ι.

35le in a &numm Θῇιιηῇῃετυ.

THE curfew tolle the knell of parting day,
The lowing honi winde slowly o'er the lea,
The ploughman homewmi plods his wensy way,
And lewes the world to darkness aud to me.

Now fades the glimmering hndseape on the sight,
And ¹³11 the air a solemn stillness holds,

Save where the beetle wheels his droning flight,
And drowsy tinklings lull the distant folda:

Save that, from yonder ivy-rnautled tower,
The mopiug owl does ω the moon complaiu

Of such ns, wanda-ing near her secret bower,
Molest her ancient solitury reign.

Han-kl how the sacred calm that breathes around
Bida every fleme tumultuous passion owse,

Iu still sanl acuente whispering from the ground
A grateful earnem of eterna] peace.
