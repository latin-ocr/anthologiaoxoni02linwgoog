ΒΥ the rivers of Babylon, fluere we snt down, yen,
we wept, when we remembered Zion,

We hunge-xl our lxm-ps upon the willows in the midai:
thereos.

For there they that carried us away captive required
of us a song3 and they that wanted ue required of us
min-th. saying‚ Sing us one of the songs of Zion⁴

How shall we sing the Loun'e song in a strange

, land?

Is I forget thee, O Jerusalem, let my right hand
fqrget her cunning.

If Ι do not remember thee, let my vongue elenve ω
the roof of my mouth ; if Ῑ prefer not Jerusalem above!
my chief joy.
