(in-um: γε rose-buda while ye may,
Old Time is still a-flying;

And this same flower that smiles to-day,
To-morrow will be dying.

The glorians lamp of heaven, the sun,
The highar he’s vgettinffi

The sooner will his nme be run,
The neas-er he's to setting.

Thac age is bemy'which ε, me first,
When youth 'ami blood ue wax-mos ;

But being spent, the wome md ποιεί
Times still duoeeed the former*

Then be not ooy; but use your time,
And while ye my, go max-173
Fur having lost but once your prime,

Yon may sor ever tun-ry.
