RQLL on, thou deep and datk blue ooean, roll.

Ten thousand fleets sweep over thee in vnin5

Mnn marks the earth with ruin; his control

Stops with the shorez upon the watery phin

The wreeks nse all thy deed; nor doeh remniu

A slmiow of uum’n ravage, save his own,

W'hen, for a moment, like n dxop uf nin,

He siuks into thy depths with bubhling gmon,
Wisswut a grave, uuknelled, unwffined, and unknown.

ΜΥ henrt leaps up when I behold
A rainbow iu the sky!
So was it, when my life begam

So let it be, when I grow old,
Or let me die*
The child is father of the man,
And 1 would wish my days ιο be

Bound each to emh by natura-l piety.
