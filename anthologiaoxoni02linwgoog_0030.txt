Cmffl, take thy harp—'t is vain to muse
Upon the guthering ills we see:

Ohl take thy lurp and let me lose
All thoughts of ill in hem-ing thee.

Sing to me, love 1— though death were near,
Thy song could make my soul fol-get —
N ay, nay, in pity dry that tear,
All may be well, be happy yet.

Let me but⁴ see tlnt snowy anu
Once more upon the deffl- harp 1ie;
Andlwilloewetodrenmoflmnu,
Will smile at fate, while thou nrt by.
