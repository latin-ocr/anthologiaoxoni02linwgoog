Yon gave me last week a young linnet
Shut up iu n fine golden cage 3
Yet how aad the poor thing was within it ῐ
Oh ! how it did flutter mvl nge Ι
'rhen he moped ancl he pined
Thac hig wings were oonfined,
Tin 1 opened the door of his den:
Then, so men-y wne hel
And, because he was free,
He came to his cuge buck again.
