WEO is this that cometh from Edam, with dyed gar- ι

ments from Bou-ah? thie that is glofious in his appu-el,
travelling in the gret-lmese of his strength ἲ Ι that &peak
in righteousness, mighty ιο save.

wherefore m thou red in :hine appasel, m‘ad thy
gat-ments like him that treadeth iu the winefat ⁴?

Ι have trodden the wine-prese alone3 and of the
people there was none with me: for Ι will tremi them
in mine auga, md trumple them in my fury', and their
blood shall be sprinkled upon my garments, md I will
stain all my miment.

For the day of vengeanoe is in my beust, and the yem-
of my redeemed ἱε omne<

And I looked, and there wne noue ιο help; and Ι
wondered that there was none ιο uphold: therefore
mine own arm brought salvation unco me ς and my fury,
it upheltl me.

And I will tremi down the people in mine anger, and
make them drunk in my fury, and Ι will bring down
their strength ιο the earth.
