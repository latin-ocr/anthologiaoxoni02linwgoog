ΒΥ foreign lamis thy dying eyes were closed,

By foreign hands thy decent h'mbs compused5

By foreign hands thy humble grave adorned,

By stru-ugera honoured, and by strangers moumed1
What though uu friendfl in suble weeds appear,
Grieve for un honr, perhaps, theu mourn a year,
And bear about the mockery of woe

To mirlnight dnuoes und the publio show?

Wtht though no weeping Loves thy ashes grace,
Nm· polished marble emulate thy face?

What though no sacred emh mllow thee mom,
Nor hnflowetl dix-ge he muttered o’er thy tomb?
Yet shall thy grave with rising nowers be dtessed,
And the green turf lie lightly on thy bremt:
There shall the mom her wliest team bestow,
There the first reses of the year shall b10w;
While angela with their silver wiugs o'ershade
The ground, now sacred by thy relies made.
