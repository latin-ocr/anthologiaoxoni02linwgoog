ωε must.

As late each flower that sweetest blowss
I plucked, the gardeu's pride,

Within the petals of a rose
A sleeping Luve I spied.

Around his brows a beamy wrmth
Of many a luoent hue;

All purple glowed his cheek benenth,
Inebrinte with dew.

I soffly seiza-i the ungunt-ded Power,
Nor med his balmy rest,

And plwed him, caged within the flower,
On spotless Snmh's breast.

But when, unweeting of the guile,
Awoke the prisoner sweet,

He struggled to escape awhile,
And smmped his fniry feet,

Ah Ε soon the soul-entrnncing sight
Subdued the impatient boy;

He gued, he thriued with deep denght,
Then olapped his wiugs for joy.
