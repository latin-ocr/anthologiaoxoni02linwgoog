XLV!-

IT was the spring, md newly risen day

Peeped o'er the hnmlets on the first os May;

My eyeS, too vender for the blnze of light,

Stin §ought tha shelter of retiring night,

When Love approwhed in painted plumes amyoti,
The insidians god his rattling darts betrayed,

Nor less his infant features, and the ely

Sweet intimatiom of his threatening eye.

Such the Sigeum boy is seen above

Fiffing the goblet for imperial Jove;

Such he ou whom the Nymphs bestowed their charms,
Hylas, who pet-iahed in a Naind’s arms:

Angry he seemed, yet grasceffi-l in his ire,

And added threna, not destitute of fite.

XLvn.
πυ a §malt ameum.

Cous, Leila, fill the goblet up,
Reneh round the rosy wine:

Thiuk not that we will take the cup
From any haud but thine-

A draught like this ‘t were vain to seekz
No gmpe can such supply3

It steals its tium from Leiln's cheek,
Its brightnees frum her eye.
