As bees
In spring-time, when the Sun with Taurus rides,
Pom· forth their populous youth about the hive
In elqsters: they among fresh dews ami flowers
Fly ιο und fro, or on the smooth‘dd plnuk,
The subm-b of their atmw-built cimdel,
N ew-rubbed with halm, exputiaoe and confer
Their state affairs, So thick the κη’ crowd
Swarmed md were atmightened ς till, the signal given,
Behold a wonder! They, but now who seemed
In bignese to surpase Ensth’s giam sons,
Now less than §mallent dwnrfs, in nmow mom
Throng numberless, like that Pygmean moe
Beyond the Indian mmmm or faery elwa,
Whose midnight revela, by a forest side
Or fountain, some balnea} pensant sees,
01⁷ drenms he seez, while uvel-head the Moon
Sit: arbitrem, md neuen· to the earth
Wheels her pale οοιιῑεθς they, on their min-h md danos
Intent, with jucund musio eham his em-;

A: ouoe with joy and fem· his hem rebouuds.
