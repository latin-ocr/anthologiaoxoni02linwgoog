Quum suffia.

O, Tuan, I see, Queeu Mab bath been with you.
She is the ffiries' midwife; und she eomes
In shape no bigger thau an agate-stone

On the fore-finger of au alderman,

Drawn with a team of little atomies

Athwart meu's nosen, as they lie nsleep:

Her wnggon-spokas made of long spinners’ lega
The cover, of the wings of gmsehoppers ;

The trwes, of the emallest spider‘s web3

The oollam, of the moonshine's watery bearna:
Her whip, of crickfit’s boue; the lash, of film:
Her waggoner‚ a small gwy-couted gunt.

Her ehariot is an empty hamel-nuc,

Made by the joiner squiri-el, or old grub,

Time out of mind the fairies' mach-mahts.

And in this etue she gallops night by night
T'hrough lovers' hrains, and then they dream of love:

On eom-tien* knew, that dream on court'sies straight:
