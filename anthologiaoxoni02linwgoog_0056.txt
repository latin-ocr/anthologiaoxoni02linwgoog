XV. ,
‘abt aruh „mmm 2⁹⁸¹ss-

Tfflzlm 'n n bower of roses by Bendemeer’s stream,
And the nightingnle singu round it all the day loug5

Iu the time of my childhood 'twnfl like a sweet dream⁷
To sit in the reses md heu the bini's song.

Thac bower and its musio I never surget,
But oft when alone, in the bloom of the year,
1 think—in the nightingale sing-ing there yet?
Are the reses still bright by the calm Bendemeer?

N o, the reses soon withered that hung o'er the νινε,
But some bloesoms were gnthered, while freshly they
shone,
And a dew was distilled from their flowers, that gave
All the stagnat-e uf summer, when summer was

gone.

Thus memory dmws from delight, ere it dies,
An essenon that brathea of it many n yenr3
ThuA bright ω my seul, us ἰνα then to my eyes,
Is that bower on the banks of the calm Bendameer.
